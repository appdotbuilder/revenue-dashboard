  // 
  // Implementation should:
  // 1. Filter sales data by product_ids if provided
  // 2. Filter by date range (start_date, end_date) if provided
  // 3. Group sales data by product and time period based on granularity
  // 4. Calculate total revenue for each product in each time period
  // 5. Include product information (product_id, product_name) in the response
  // 6. Return data points with period labels, revenue amounts, and product details
